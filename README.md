# ProjectB

Repository for keeping track of code created during project on simulations of operator scrambling. So far this only includes code needed to compute operator entanglement of super-Clifford circuits, but the repository will be updated as the project develops.

All code is written in python, and the simulation of super-Clifford circuits is done using stim, a Clifford circuit simulator. This can be installed using the following command:

'pip install stim
